# TV Script Generation

In this project, we'll generate our own [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts using RNNs.  we'll be using part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons.  The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

## Get the Data

The data is already provided  in `./data/Seinfeld_Scripts.txt` and we're encouraged to open that file and look at the text. 
>* As a first step, we'll load in this data and look at some samples. 
>* Then, we'll be tasked with defining and training an RNN to generate a new script!
